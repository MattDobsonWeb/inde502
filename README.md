# INDE502 - Movie Fan Social Network

> Social network app for movie/tv fans built with the MERN stack. This is for a university module 'INDE502'.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
cd client
npm install

# Run the server and react front end (remember to cd out of client)
npm run dev

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000, client runs on http://localhost:3000
```

For staff @ Plymouth University, **keys_dev.js** will be required to run in development.
This is included in the Code Submission folder but not from the repo due to security.
